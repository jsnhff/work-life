Busy is the new black.
Be all the data you can be.
Accelerate yourself.
Optimization is the only way to accomplish present success in competition with others.
Deal with it.
Work. Work. Work.
You are your job.
You are a productivity rave.
Optimize your life.
Accelerate yourself.
Become the capital you dream about.
Theoretical purchases are aesthetic enjoyment.
Conceptualise capitalist futures.
You are always emerging.
Become complexity, globality, and technology.
Yes is the new no.
Leisure time is work time.
You are totally being present.
Health rave your way into the day!
Focus on value production.
Streamline your rituals for optimal results.
Off the clock is the new on the clock.
Waste time by working.
Never stop testing, and you will never stop improving.
